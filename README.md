# Blognow

Blognow is my personal responsive blog site developed using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), Firebase, and Vanilla JavaScript. It provides a clean and user-friendly platform for sharing my thoughts and experiences through blog posts.

Built with a frontend crafted using HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS, Blognow allows visitors to explore and read my blogs seamlessly. Firebase serves as the backend, handling data storage and hosting.
